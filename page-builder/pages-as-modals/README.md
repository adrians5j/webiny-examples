In short, the element allows the user to pick any number of cards to be rendered within the dropped page element.

Every card item consists of two fields: title and image. Of course, fields can be adjusted if need be. Also, the image field brings Webiny's File Manager app, so that the user can choose an image from an existing library of images.

All files are located in the [`/apps/theme/pageElements/cards`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/tree/master/page-builder/cards-page-element/apps/theme/pageElements/cards) folder.
