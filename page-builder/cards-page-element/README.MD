The element allows the user to pick any number of cards to be rendered in the actual page element.

Every element consists of two fields: title and image (picked via Webiny's File Manager app). Of course, fields can be adjusted if need be.

All files are located in the [`/apps/theme/pageElements/cards`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/tree/master/page-builder/cards-page-element/apps/theme/pageElements/cards) folder.
