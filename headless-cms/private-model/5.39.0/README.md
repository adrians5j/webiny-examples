## Private Models
[Private Models](https://www.webiny.com/docs/headless-cms/extending/private-models) are hidden from the admin app UI. These models are defined programmatically through a plugin. While the schema and resolvers arenâ€™t auto-generated, developers have the freedom to design them on the backend or API.
This is the codebase for the [Private Models](https://www.webiny.com/docs/headless-cms/extending/private-models) guide.
